Now let me provide you with the enhanced code. I'll give you updated files for both the backend and frontend:

## Enhanced AI Smart Assistant Implementation

Here's the complete enhanced solution:

### 1. **Enhanced Backend - Improved AI Chat Function**

Replace the contents of [supabase/functions/ai-chat/index.ts](supabase/functions/ai-chat/index.ts) with:

```typescript
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts";

const corsHeaders = {
  "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
  "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "authorization, x-client-info, apikey, content-type",
};

// Service
```
